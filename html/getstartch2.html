<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent">This central chapter describes how to build <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>on several systems. In case you
are on a Win32 (i. e. Windows95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP) platform or any of the other
platforms for which binary executables are available, you may not want to go through
that potentially troublesome process but skip this chapter instead and straightly
go to the next one. (Not everyone wants to build his or her plane himself or
herself, right?) However, there may be good reason for at least trying to build the
simulator:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">In case you are on a UNIX<a 
  name="dx6-10001"></a>/Linux<a 
  name="dx6-10002"></a> platform there may be no pre-compiled
     binaries<a 
  name="dx6-10003"></a>  available  for  your  system.  In  practice  it  is  common  to  install
     programs like this one on UNIX<a 
  name="dx6-10004"></a> systems by recompiling them.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">There are several options you can set during compile time only.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You may be proud you did.</li></ul>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent">On the other hand, compiling <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is not a task for novice users. Thus, if you&#8217;re a
beginner (we all were once) on a platform which binaries<a 
  name="dx6-10005"></a> are available for, we
recommend postponing this task and just starting with the binary distribution<a 
  name="dx6-10006"></a> to get you
flying.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent">   As you will notice, this Chapter is far from being complete. Basically, we describe
compiling for two operating systems only, Windows<a 
  name="dx6-10007"></a> and Linux<a 
  name="dx6-10008"></a>, and for only one
compiler, the GNU C compiler. <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>has been shown to be built under different
compilers (including Microsoft Visual C) as well as different systems (Macintosh) as
well. The reason for these limitations are:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Personally,  we  have  access  to  a  Windows  machine  running  the  Cygnus
     compiler only.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">According to the mailing lists, these seem to be the systems with the largest
     user base.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">These are the simplest systems to compile <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>on. Other compilers
     may need special add-ons (workplace etc.) or even modification of the code.
                                                                     

                                                                     
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The GNU compiler is free in the same sense of the GPL as <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is.</li></ul>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent">You might want to check Section <a 
href="getstartap1.html#x12-66000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: missed--></a>, <span 
class="ptmri7t---109">Missed approach</span>, if anything fails during
compilation. In case this does not help we recommend sending a note to one of the
mailing lists (for hints on subscription see Chapter <a

<!--l. 73--><p class="indent">   There are several Linux distributions<a 
  name="dx6-10009"></a> on the market, and most of them should work.
Some come even bundled with (often outdated) versions of <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>. However, if you
are going to download or buy a distribution, Debian<a 
  name="dx6-10010"></a> (Woody) is suggested by most
people. SuSE<a 
  name="dx6-10011"></a> works well, too.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent">   Contrary to Linux/Unix systems, Windows usually comes without any development
tools. This way, you first have to install a development environment. On Windows, in a
sense, before building the plane you will have to build the plant for building planes.
This will be the topic of the following section, which can be omitted by Linux
users.

<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent">There is a powerful development environment available for Windows and this
even for free: The Cygnus development tools,<a

href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/" >http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>,

<!--l. 97--><p class="indent">   Nowadays, installing <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">Cygwin</span><a 
  name="dx6-11002"></a> is nearly automatic. First, make sure the drive you want

class="ptmbi7t---109">SimGear </span>and <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>to live on, has nearly 1 GB of free disk space<a 
  name="dx6-11003"></a>.
Create a temporary directory and download the installer from the site named
above to that directory. (While the installer does an automatic installation of the
Cygnus environment, it is a good idea to download a new installer from time to
time.)
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent">   Invoke the installer now. It gives you three options. To avoid having to download
stuff twice in case of a re-installation or installation on a second machine, we highly
recommended to take a two-step procedure. First, select the option <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">Download</span>
<span 
class="pcrr7t---109">from Internet</span>. Insert the path of your temporary directory, your Internet
connection settings and then choose a mirror form the list. Near servers might
be preferred, but may be sometimes a bit behind with mirroring. We found

start. Now choose <span

select a root directory (acting as the root directory of your pseudo UNIX file
system). Cygnus does not recommend taking the actual root directory of a drive,
thus choose <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">c:/Cygwin </span>(while other drives than <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">c: </span>work as well). Now, all
<span

class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>&#8217;s
configuration scripts will detect the XFree86 OpenGL libraries and link to them, while
the code is not prepared to do so.
<!--l. 154--><p class="indent">   As a final step you should include the binary directory<a 
  name="dx6-11006"></a> (for instance:
<br class="newline"><span

the named directory.
<!--l. 158--><p class="indent">   Now you are done. Fortunately, all this is required only once. At this point you have a
nearly UNIX-like (command line) development environment. Because of this, the
following steps are nearly identical under Windows and Linux/Unix.

<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent">Linux, like any UNIX, usually comes with a compiler pre-installed. On the other hand,
you still have to make sure several required libraries are present.
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent">   First, make sure you have all necessary OpenGL libraries. Fortunately, most of the
recent Linux distributions (i.e. SuSE-7.3) put these already into the right place. (There
have been reports, though, that on Slackware you may have to copy the libraries to

building <span

stuff you want to have - SuSE as an example - the following packages: mesa,
mesa-devel, mesasoft, xf86_glx, xf86glu, xf86glu-devel, mesaglut, mesaglut-devel and
plib.
<!--l. 171--><p class="indent">   Also you are expected to have a bunch of tools installed that are usually required to
compile the Linux kernel. So you may use the Linux kernel source package to determine
the required dependencies. The following packages might prove to be useful when
fiddling with the <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>sources: automake, autoconf, libtool, bison, flex and some
more, that are not required to build a Linux kernel.

<!--l. 535--><p class="noindent">Compiling on other UNIX<a 
  name="dx6-18001"></a> systems - at least on IRIX<a 
  name="dx6-18002"></a> and on Solaris<a 
  name="dx6-18003"></a>, is pretty similar to
the procedure on Linux - given the presence of a working GNU C compiler. Especially
IRIX and also recent releases of Solaris come with the basic OpenGL libraries.<a 
  name="dx6-18004"></a>
Unfortunately the &#8221;glut&#8221; libraries are mostly missing and have to be installed separately
(see the introductory remark to this chapter). As compilation of the &#8221;glut&#8221; sources is not
a trivial task to everyone, you might want to use a pre-built binary. Everything you need
is a static library &#8221;libglut.a&#8221; and an include file &#8221;glut.h&#8221;. An easy way to make them
usable is to place them into <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">/usr/lib/ </span>and <span 
class="pcrr7t---109">/usr/include/GL/</span>. In case you insist
on building the library yourself, you might want to have a look at FreeGLUT<a

compiler doesn&#8217;t stop with &#8221;internal compiler error&#8221;). Things might look better if Eric
