Eisenhower. The carriers are equipped with working catapult, arrester wires, elevators,
TACAN and FLOLS and are currently available for aircraft using the YASim FDM (in

href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-57" id="x10-570005.1.2">Launching from the Catapult</a></h4>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent">Once FlightGear has started, you should ensure that the parking brakes are off and press
&#8220;L&#8221; to engage the launchbar (this might be best done from an external view initially.) You
should notice the aircraft being pulled into alignment with the catapult and see the strops
appear and hold down the aircraft. This will only happen if your aircraft is close enough
to the correct spot on the catapult; as a rough guide, for the default parking
position the seahawk&#8217;s nose should be rougly level with the deck observation
bubble.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent">   To get the carrier into as good a position as possible for launch, select the &#8220;ATC/AI&#8221;
menu, then check the "Turn into wind" box under the &#8220;AI Carrier&#8221; section. You
should now notice the carrier begin to pick up speed and turn into the wind,
and naturally the deck may tilt somewhat as it turns. You should wait for this
maneuver to finish and the deck to return to level before moving on to the next
stage.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent">   Being engaged to the catapult, you should spool up the engines to full power, ensure
the brakes are off and that all flight controls are in a suitable position for launch
(stick held right back with the seahawk.) When ready, press &#8220;C&#8221; to release the
catapult. Your aircraft will be hurled forward off the deck, and you should be
able to raise the undercarriage and climb slowly away, being careful to avoid
stalling.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.3    </span> <a 
href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-58" id="x10-580005.1.3">Finding the Carrier - TACAN</a></h4>
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent">Actually finding the carrier in a vast expanse of open water can be very difficult,
especially if visibility is poor. To assist with this task, Nimitz is equipped with TACAN,
which allows a suitably-equipped aircraft (Seahawk at present) to obtain a range
and bearing to the carrier. First, you must set the appropriate TACAN channel,
029Y in this case, in the radios dialogue (ctrl-r or choose Equipment/Radio
Settings from the FG menubar). You should, if within range, notice the DME
instrument show your distance from the carrier, and the ADF instrument (next to
the DME in the seahawk) should indicate a bearing to the carrier. Turn to the
                                                                     

                                                                     
indicated heading and you should see the DME dial indicate your closing in on the
carrier.

href="getstartli1.html#QQ2-10-59" id="x10-590005.1.4">Landing on the Carrier</a></h4>
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent">This is the most difficult part of the operation, as in real life. You might well find Andy
Ross&#8217; tutorial on operating the A4 Skyhawk useful here. It is available from
here:
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent"><a 
href="http://www.seedwiki.com/wiki/flight_gear/a4_skyhawk.cfm?wpid=209330" >http://www.seedwiki.com/wiki/flight_gear/a4_skyhawk.cfm?wpid=209330</a>
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent">   Basically you should use the TACAN to locate the carrier, and line up with the rear
of the deck. As this part of the deck is at an angle to the course of the vessel,
you may need to correct your alignment often. Ensure that the aircraft is in
the correct configuration for approach (the Help/Aircraft Help menu should
contain useful data for your aircraft) and that the gear and the arrestor hook are
down.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent">   As you approach you should see, on the left hand side of the deck, a set of brightly
coloured lights - called the Fresnel Lens Optical landing System (FLOLS). This indicates
your position on the landing glideslope. You will see a horizontal row of green lights,
and when approximately on the glideslope, an orange light (known in some
circles as the &#8220;meatball&#8221;) approximately in line with the green lights. When
approaching correctly, the meatball appears in line with the green lights. If you are
high it is above, and when low it is below. If you are very low the meatball
turns red. If you fly to keep the meatball aligned you should catch number 3
wire.
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent">   Carrier landings are often described as &#8220;controlled crashes&#8221; and you shouldn&#8217;t waste
your time attempting to flare and place the aircraft gently on the deck like you would
with a conventional landing - ensuring that you catch the wires is the main
thing.
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent">   Immediately your wheels touch the deck, you should open the throttles to full power,
in case you have missed the wires and need to &#8220;go around&#8221; again; the wires will hold the
aircraft if you have caught them, even at full power.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent">   If you wish, you can then (with 0.9.10 and later) raise the elevators from the ATC/AI
menu, taxy onto one of the elevators, lower it (uncheck the box on the menu) and taxy off
into the hangar.
<!--l. 150--><p class="indent">   Don&#8217;t be discouraged if you don&#8217;t succeed at first - it&#8217;s not an easy maneouver to
master. If after a little practice you find the Seahawk too easy, you could move on to the
Seafire for more of a challenge!

<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent">Otherwise, your connection is likely via some kind of router that connects to your
computer via an RJ-45, or "Ethernet" connector (similar shape to most Western telephone
plugs), or by a wireless link. You need to find the IP address of that network
interface.
<!--l. 225--><p class="indent">   Under linux, this can be found by logging in as root and typing "ifconfig". You may
find more than one interface listed, beginning with "lo" - ignore that one. You should
have something like "eth0" or "wlan0" also listed - look through this block of text for
"inet addr". This will be followed directly by the number you&#8217;re looking for, e.g. "inet

5002 to the IP address you&#8217;ve just found. This is not something that can be described in
step-by-step detail, because each manufacturer&#8217;s configuration interfaces differ greatly.
Some tips are given here - if you get stuck, ask nicely on the FlightGear IRC channel for
help (details on the flightgear website).
<!--l. 244--><p class="indent">   You should know how to log on to your router&#8217;s configuration page, usually via a
web browser. You are looking for settings pertaining to "port forwarding" "virtual server"
"Forwarding Rules" or similar. When you have found the relevant settings, you need to
add a rule that forwards port 5000 or 5002 (depending on which server you
wish to join - add both if you like) to the IP address you discovered earlier. If
there is a choice given, ensure it is UDP ports that are forwarded. If there is no
choice, you may assume that both TCP and UDP are being forwarded. Save your
configuration, and most routers will probably then need to be rebooted to apply the
changes.
<!--l. 251--><p class="indent">   Note: (for BSD users) If you are using a ADSL modem, you might have to put the
port forward command into the ppp.conf file rather than firewall. This is because the

<!--l. 554--><p class="noindent">At present, there are two tanker aircraft (KC135-E and KA6-D) and three receiving
aircraft (A4F, Lightning and T38) capable of in-air refuelling. When flying one of these
aircraft in the default scenery area, one can locate the tanker aircraft using air-air TACAN
and/or radar and then receive a full or partial load of fuel by flying in close
formation behind the tanker. Refuelling is also possible between aircraft in a
MultiPlayer session. The KC135 is a boom refueller, while the KA6 has a hose.
The A4F and Lightning are both fitted with a probe for hose refuelling while
the T38 is fitted with a boom receiver. At the moment, either type can refuel
from any tanker, but in the future it is likely that the correct type will have to be
used.

<!--l. 568--><p class="noindent">Like the aircraft carriers, AAR is implemented as an "AI scenario". Selecting
these normally requires editing the "preferences.xml" file in the flightgear data
directory.
<!--l. 572--><p class="indent">   There is a shortcut in this case though; simply selecting the Lightning, A4F or T38
should automatically load a scenario containing a tanker, assuming you haven&#8217;t changed
anything in your preferences.xml file.
<!--l. 577--><p class="indent">   Assuming this is the case, choose one of the aforementioned aircraft, make sure that
"AI models" are enabled and start at KSFO (the default airport.)
<!--l. 581--><p class="indent">   Depending on the scenario, you might see the tanker crossing overhead when the sim

<!--l. 586--><p class="noindent">Perhaps the first thing to do after starting the engines if necessary is to select the
appropriate TACAN channel if your aircraft is so equipped (the A4F and Lightning both
are). For the KC135 (by default used by the Lightning and T37) this is currently "040X",
and for the KA6D (used by the A4F) it is "050X". Enter this channel using the relevant
dropdown boxes in the "radios" dialogue (from the menus, "equipment/radios" or press
control-r).
<!--l. 594--><p class="indent">   You should now see the current bearing to the tanker indicated in the nav display of
the A4 or the TACAN indicator (green needle) in the Lightning. If the tanker is within

screen. Around 5nm away, you should reduce your speed to around 20kts faster than the
tanker (these fly at 280 kts TAS) - a "slow overtake". The KC135 will be visible
from about 10nm, the KA6-D, being smaller, just over 1 nm. You should use
airbrakes as necessary to keep control of your speed should you find yourself
overshooting.
<!--l. 610--><p class="indent">   Close to within 50ft of the tanker (don&#8217;t get too close, or visual artifacts might hide
the boom from view). You should see indication in the cockpit that you are receiving fuel
- there is a green light in the A4 fuel gauge, and you should see the indicated tank load
increase.
<!--l. 615--><p class="indent">   Getting to this stage is not necessarily easy - it can take a lot of practice.
As with carrier landings, this is not an easy manoeuver in real life either and
there are additional complications in the sim; the tanker, being an AI model, is
unaffected by the wind and flies TAS (True Air Speed), while you are flying IAS
(Indicated Air Speed) and are affected by the environment. As in real life, your
aircraft will also steadily increase in weight as the tanks fill which will affect the
trim of the aircraft. (You might find it helpful to use the autothrottle to help
control your speed - ctrl-a then Page Up/Down to increase and decrease the set
speed.)
<!--l. 626--><p class="indent">   Once your tanks are full, or you have taken as much fuel as you wish, close the
throttle a little, back away from the tanker and continue your intended flight.

     <!--l. 636--><p class="noindent">Refuelling is possible within a MultiPlayer session given certain conditions.
     A basic flyable KC135 model is available - the pilot of this aircraft should
     use the callsign "MOBIL1", "MOBIL2" or "MOBIL3". Other numbers are
     acceptable, but only these three have A-A TACAN channels assigned. These
     are 060X, 061X and 062X respectively.

     means disabling (commenting out) all refuelling "scenarios" in the relevant
     aircraft-set.xml and in preferences.xml.
     <!--l. 648--><p class="noindent">MP refuelling works in exactly the same way as AI refuelling and is a fun
     challenge. It is best to ensure that your network connection is as free from
     interruptions as possible; the MP code does a degree of prediction if there
     is a "blip" in the stream of packets and this can make close formation flight
     very difficult or even impossible.
